# GoLang Native Website with MySQL and Bootstrap 5

This repository is a hands-on case study for learning native Go (Golang) without using any framework. The project involves building a simple website connected to a MySQL database and styled with Bootstrap 5.

## Objectives

- Learn the basics of Go for web development.
- Understand how to connect a Go application to a MySQL database.
- Practice writing SQL queries in Go.
- Implement `http.HandlerFunc` for handling web requests.
- Use Bootstrap 5 for front-end styling.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a minimalistic website using native Go capabilities. We'll cover fundamental aspects such as:

- Setting up a Go project.
- Connecting to a MySQL database.
- Performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Managing routes and handling HTTP requests/responses using Go's standard library.
- Applying Bootstrap 5 for a responsive and modern UI.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.17 or higher recommended)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- Basic knowledge of SQL
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Go Dependencies**

   The project might use external packages. To install these dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Set Up MySQL Database**

   - Create a MySQL database and table as per the SQL schema provided in the `/db` directory.
   - Update the `config.go` file with your database credentials (username, password, database name).

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the Go server using:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The server should start running at `http://localhost:8080`.

5. **Open the Website**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the website in action.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Database Connection:** Learn how to establish a connection between Go and a MySQL database.
- **SQL Queries:** Execute SQL commands directly within Go to manipulate data.
- **Handler Functions:** Utilize `http.HandlerFunc` to manage different routes and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Bootstrap 5 Integration:** Style your web pages with Bootstrap 5 for a responsive, modern look without custom CSS.
